# iPhone Style Calculator (Flask + Vanilla JS)

This project is a browser calculator UI backed by a small Flask API.


## Run Locally

1. Move into the **Calculator** directory:
```bash
cd Calculator
```

3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the backend server:

```bash
py .\app.py
```

4. Open `index.html` in a browser to launch the front-end. Alternatively, if you have Live Server extension, you can open `index.html` with Live Server.


***Note***: The frontend calls the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.

# Engineering Intern Interview Questions

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in the Nucleus Security Engineering
internship program! This document contains 2 primary interview
challenges for you. The first is a code review question, and the second
is a coding challenge.

For both, we absolutely encourage the use of AI. If you do use AI, we
would like for you to share your prompts and then answer the follow-up
questions about how you thought through your prompts.

We know this time of the year is crazy for college students and that
your time is very valuable. Please try not to spend more than about 1
total hour collectively on this.

# Code Review (10 minutes)

You are welcome and encouraged to use AI for this section. If you do,
please provide your prompts and answer the questions in the follow-up
section.

## Task

Your colleague or team member was given the following task:

1.  Add a `/webhook` endpoint to receive vendor events about users who
    are vendors.

2.  Input data will look like:

    ``` json
    {"email":"a@b.com","role":"admin","metadata":{"source":"vendor"}}
    ```

3.  Verify signature header `X-Signature`.

4.  Parse JSON and upsert the user data.

5.  Store the raw payload for audit/debug.

They have opened a PR with the code below. Review the code and comment
on any issues you find.

**Note:** Both the PHP and Python do the same thing. You can choose to
review whichever one you want. It is not intended for you to review
both.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PHP

``` php
<?php
// webhook.php
require_once "db.php"; // provides $pdo (PDO instance)

// Config (dev defaults)
$WEBHOOK_SECRET = getenv("WEBHOOK_SECRET") ?: "dev-secret";
$DB_AUDIT_ENABLED = getenv("AUDIT_ENABLED") ?: "true";

function verify_signature($sig, $body, $secret) {
    // Vendor docs: SHA256(secret + body)
    $expected = hash("sha256", $secret . $body);
    return $expected == $sig; // simple compare
}

$method = $_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] ?? "GET";
$path = parse_url($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"], PHP_URL_PATH);

// Basic routing
if ($method !== "POST" || $path !== "/webhook") {
    http_response_code(404);
    echo "not found";
    exit;
}

$raw = file_get_contents("php://input"); // raw body string
$sig = $_SERVER["HTTP_X_SIGNATURE"] ?? "";

if (!verify_signature($sig, $raw, $WEBHOOK_SECRET)) {
    http_response_code(401);
    echo "bad sig";
    exit;
}

// Decode JSON
$payload = json_decode($raw, true);
$email = $payload["email"] ?? "";
$role = $payload["role"] ?? "user";

// Store raw payload for auditing / debugging
if ($DB_AUDIT_ENABLED) {
    $pdo->exec("INSERT INTO webhook_audit(email, raw_json) VALUES ('$email', '$raw')");
}

// Upsert user (simple)
$pdo->exec("INSERT INTO users(email, role) VALUES('$email', '$role')");

echo "ok";
```

## Python

``` python
# app.py
import os
import json
import sqlite3
import hashlib
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)
DB_PATH = os.getenv("DB_PATH", "/tmp/app.db")
WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv("WEBHOOK_SECRET", "dev-secret")  # default for dev

def get_db():
    return sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)

def verify(sig, body: bytes) -> bool:
    # Vendor docs: SHA256(secret + body)
    expected = hashlib.sha256(
        (WEBHOOK_SECRET + body.decode("utf-8")).encode("utf-8")
    ).hexdigest()
    return expected == sig  # simple compare

@app.post("/webhook")
def webhook():
    raw = request.data  # bytes
    sig = request.headers.get("X-Signature", "")

    if not verify(sig, raw):
        return ("bad sig", 401)

    payload = json.loads(raw.decode("utf-8"))

    # Example payload:
    # {"email":"a@b.com","role":"admin","metadata":{"source":"vendor"}}
    email = payload.get("email", "")
    role = payload.get("role", "user")

    db = get_db()
    cur = db.cursor()

    # Store raw payload for auditing / debugging
    cur.execute(
        f"INSERT INTO webhook_audit(email, raw_json) VALUES ('{email}', '{raw.decode('utf-8')}')"
    )

    # Upsert user
    cur.execute(
        f"INSERT INTO users(email, role) VALUES('{email}', '{role}')"
    )

    db.commit()

    return ("ok", 200)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

## Code comments

Put your code comments here. For comments on specific lines, please
include the line number. Feel free to comment on the general task as
well.

1. SQL statements in webhook() should be parameterized. Your f-string is susceptible to a SQL injection attacks since its not sanitizing user inputs. An attack can just break out of the query and inject their own SQL query.

2. The webhook secret on line 10 shouldn't default to the development secret if it fails. From my experience - the development, QA, and production server secrets should be kept independent. I would suggest printing or logging an error before terminating the service.

3. For verify(), you can use the compare_digest(arg1, arg2) function from the hmac library, which is also a suggestion from the hashlib python docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.sha256

4. You should be closing your sqlite connection after every request. See teardown here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/sqlite3/

5. Use try-except statements to return error messages if something goes wrong (i.e. if we can't connect to database, don't leave the user hanging)

## Follow-up Questions

1.  Share your prompts and the AI outputs.
2.  For each prompt:
    -   Tell us what you were hoping for the AI to accomplish.
    -   Tell us what it actually did.
    -   Did you have to re-prompt it based on its output?
    -   If you had to change your approach, why?

# Coding Challenge (\~50 minutes)

For the below coding exercise, there is no expectation that you will
have a fully working solution. For anything you feel you didn't
accomplish, please let us know in the follow-up section after the
exercise.

## Exercise

Build a calculator web application. It should include a frontend piece
and any backend logic needed to perform the calculations.

You can use any language of your choosing for both the frontend and
backend code.
